MOBILE APP STATISTICS PROJECT

INTRODUCTION

This project is about collecting insights on how the details of an application (name, cost, currency, size and description) can affect its user ratings on the app store. We are going to compare the statistics of different app groups to come up with a clear conclusion.

BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM

The ever-changing mobile landscape is a challenging space to navigate. The percentage of mobile over desktop is only increasing. Android holds about 53.2% of the smartphone market, while iOS is 43%. To get more people to download your app, you need to make sure they can easily find your app. 
The factor that drives this goal is the user ratings of the app and the number of downloads. With the analytics collected in this project, app developers will be able to understand the strategy to deploy in order to drive growth and retain future users.
Mainly, we are going to focus on key details of an application on the store such as its cost, description, size of the app and the group to which the application belongs (shopping, game, news, etc.) and observe how these details correlate with the user ratings. 
We shall be observing the shift in the ratings between the previous versions and the current version in order to make a more detailed report.
PROBLEM
Getting user ratings is hard and getting positive (4/5 stars) app ratings is of course even harder. App developers around the world are not aware of the target market for their apps and the different app groups that people are most interested in which limits the success of their apps on the app store.
GOAL
To help developers get more people to download their applications.

OBJECTIVES

1.	Collecting analysis on how different application details affect the user ratings of an application on the store.
2.	To compare the statistics of different app groups and so that the app developer may know which app group the users are most interested in.

OUTCOMES

We are expecting to come up with a detailed analysis of the applestore.csv dataset showing how the app details affect the user rating and visualized comparisons of different app groups
We hope that this analysis will help app developers develop applications that will attain a higher user rating.
